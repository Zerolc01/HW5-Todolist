# HW5-Todolist

This project is my homework in CS175.

In this project, I used Kotlin to complete a Todolist against the provided java code.

My Work:
- Create a database for the Todo List scene, complete the design and creation of the database table.
- After entering the homepage, all the data in the database is displayed in the form of a list.
- After clicking "+", jump to a new page, enter any content, insert the content into the database, return to the home page and update the UI.
- Click any checkbox to set the note as completed, and update the database and UI.
- Click any "x" to delete the note, and update the database and UI.

But what makes me very sad is that my last delete function does not know why there is a bug, and I cannot click my delete button.

I will try to debug and update the code.
